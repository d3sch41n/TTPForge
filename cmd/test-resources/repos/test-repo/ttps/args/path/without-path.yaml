name: Testing Path Type Arguments - Failure
description: |
  This TTP powers the test case
  "Argument with `type: path` - Should Fail"
  in `cmd/run_test.go`
args:
  - name: target_path
    description: |
      If a valid relative path is provided for this argument, the TTP
      will still fail because it will run from the TTP's configuration
      directory and that path won't exist there
steps:
  - name: cat_target_path
    inline: cat {{.Args.target_path}}
