name: Demo of the path_exists Post-Execution Check
description: |
  The `path_exists` check can be used to verify that a given
  file exists and has the correct hash. This helps
  TTP authors ensure that their TTP executed correctly and wasn't
  blocked by EDR/AV.
requirements:
  platforms:
    - os: darwin
    - os: linux
tests:
  - name: default
steps:
  - name: create_demo_file
    create_file: |-
      {{$target_path := (printf "/tmp/ttpforge-path-exists-demo-%v" (randAlphaNum 10))}}{{$target_path}}
    contents: foo
    cleanup: default
    checks:
      - msg: "Expected path does not exist or does not have correct contents!"
        path_exists: "{{$target_path}}"
