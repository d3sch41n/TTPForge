name: Basic Cleanup Demonstration
description: |
  If a step fails, we stop executing new steps, and begin
  cleaning up the prior steps in reverse order starting from the last
  successful step.
steps:
  - name: first_step
    print_str: |
      This step completes successfully, so its cleanup action will be enqueued.
    cleanup:
      print_str: Cleaning up first_step
  - name: second_step
    print_str: So does this step.
    cleanup:
      print_str: Cleaning up second_step
  - name: third_step
    inline: |
      echo "This step fails, so it will not have its cleanup action run..."
      notarealcommandwillcauseafailure
    cleanup:
      print_str: This won't run!
  - name: fourth_step
    print_str: |
      Since the previous step failed, this step won't run at all...
    cleanup:
      print_str: ...and therefore its cleanup action won't run either.
