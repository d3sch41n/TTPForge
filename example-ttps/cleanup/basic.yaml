name: Basic Cleanup Demonstration
description: |
  Every time a step completes successfully, its cleanup action is enqueued.
  Then, the enqueued cleanup steps are run in reverse order
  ("last in, first out") whenever:
    1. The TTP Completes Successfully, or...
    2. A Step Fails
steps:
  - name: first_step
    print_str: |
      This step completes successfully, so its cleanup action will be enqueued.
    cleanup:
      print_str: "Cleaning up first_step"
  - name: second_step
    print_str: |
      This step has no cleanup action defined, so it will be skipped during cleanup
  - name: third_step
    print_str: |
      This step uses an `inline:` action instead of a `print_str:` action
      as its cleanup action - you may use any of TTPForge's supported action types
      as a cleanup action.
    cleanup:
      inline: echo "Cleaning up third_step"
